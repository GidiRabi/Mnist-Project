# Machine Learning Project Proposal - MNIST Dataset
## Team Members: Gidi Rabi & Roi Bruchim

### Introduction
The MNIST dataset is one of the most widely used benchmarks for evaluating machine learning algorithms in image recognition. Its simplicity and significance in the field make it an ideal choice for exploring the performance of various machine learning models. This project aims to implement, compare, and analyze the performance of different algorithms, gaining insights into their strengths, limitations, and computational trade-offs.

### Objectives
1. Evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning models on the MNIST dataset.
2. Analyze the trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and computation time.
3. Investigate specific patterns of misclassification and the reasons behind them.
4. Explore feature importance using methods such as decision paths and CNN feature maps.
5. Assess the effects of artificial class imbalance on model performance.

### Selected Models
We have chosen a diverse set of machine learning models to provide a comprehensive analysis:
1. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Known for its theoretical robustness and effectiveness with kernels like RBF for non-linear decision boundaries.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** A standard in image classification tasks, capable of capturing spatial hierarchies in data.
3. **Random Forest:** Provides feature importance insights and handles non-linear relationships effectively.
4. **Logistic Regression:** Serves as a baseline model for linear classification.
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Simple and interpretable, focusing on local similarity in feature space.
