Key Questions Answered
How does computation time compare between models?
SVM: Longer training time due to the high-dimensional feature space and lack of GPU acceleration.
CNN: Faster training with GPU support and optimized batch processing. However, inference might be slower for CNN due to model complexity.
Does the added complexity of CNN justify its improved accuracy?
Yes, CNNs typically outperform SVMs in image classification tasks because they learn hierarchical features (e.g., edges, textures), which are critical for images.
Which digits are frequently misclassified?
Analyze the confusion matrix. Both SVM and CNN may struggle with similar-looking digits (e.g., 3 vs. 5 or 7 vs. 1).
Why are certain digits harder to classify?
Digits with high variability in writing styles or similarity to other digits are misclassified more often. CNNs are better at handling these variations than SVMs.
Which model brings the best overall results for this dataset?
CNN typically provides better accuracy and generalization due to its ability to learn spatial features.
How do models perform when visualized?
Confusion matrices and success rates by digit provide insights into model performance and areas for improvement.
Trade-offs between simplicity, accuracy, and computational cost:
SVM: Simpler to interpret but computationally expensive for large datasets and less accurate for images.
CNN: Complex but provides better accuracy and scalability for image classification tasks.
