How This Code Answers Your Questions

1. Computation Time (Training/Testing)

The code measures and prints the training time and inference time for SVM.
Output: Training Time: X seconds, Inference Time: Y seconds.
2. Frequently Misclassified Digits

The confusion matrix and misclassified digits visualization show which digits are frequently confused.
Output: Heatmap of confusion matrix and images of misclassified digits.
3. Why Are Certain Digits Harder to Classify?

By visualizing misclassified digits, you can analyze if they are ambiguous (e.g., 4 vs. 9, 7 vs. 1).
Output: Misclassified digits with true and predicted labels.
4. Feature Importance

For SVM with a linear kernel, feature importance can be analyzed using coefficients. For RBF kernel, feature importance is not directly interpretable.
Output: Bar plot of feature importance (if using linear kernel).
5. Model Performance (Accuracy)

The code calculates and prints the accuracy of the SVM model.
Output: SVM Accuracy: X.XXXX.
6. Statistical Analysis

The classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each digit.
Output: Precision, recall, and F1-score per class.
